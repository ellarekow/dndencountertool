# dndencountertool

This tool is used to help automate the Dungeon Master's (DM) process of enounters the the table top RPG Dungeons and Dragon. In encounters, your Real Players (or RP) have to defeat the Non Player enemies (NPCE's), sometimes with help of Non Player Characters (NPCs). Each RP and NPC(E) go in a specified order defined at the beggining of the enouter. The encounter continues untill all NPCE's are killed, all the players run, or the RP's all die. However, if a RP gets to 0 HP, they go into death saves. In order to survive death saves, the RP needs to roll a 10 or higher 3 times to return to 1 HP (My house rules), if they fail, they die forever. However, if you roll a 20, it counts for 2 saves, and a 1 counts for 2 deaths.
